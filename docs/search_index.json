It is “a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States”. We find it is unique because it: “combines interviews and physical examinations”. This allows us to look at objective trends like height and weight as well as data from personal experience like smoking and depression. We can also combine the two to see if one has impact on the other. The data NHANES offers is expansive and we had to look carefully for bits and pieces we wanted to examine because there were so many variables to sift through. We eventually decided on questioning some “common sense” ideas we had in order to see if they actually had grounding in real-world data. For example, we ask things like: do people who work more drink more coffee, do people who started smoking earlier have stunted growth, does income really affect nutrition that much, do people really “let themselves go” once they are married and older, and many more. In the end, we were able to find evidence of some of these “common sense” ideas whereas for others we could not find anything meaningful. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic This project’s topic will be the relationships between demographic, diet, and behavior/health conditions of humans. We are interested in seeing trends between these categories as well as within them. For example, we could compare within categories by using a parallel-coordinates plot to visualize the correlations between different nutrients in the total nutrient intake, or we could compare between categories, like comparing distributions in a mosaic plot of gender, income, and smoking vs. nonsmoking. There are some clearly known examples of these relationships such as diet and weight, or diet and diabetes, which we will be able to show here in order to demonstrate the magnitude of their effects. With this data and analysis, we may also be able to make inferences on the causes of these effects. However, there will also be some lesser-known or unknown trends we are able to uncover in this data. We can apply the same analysis to these trends, although it may be harder to make inferences due to the fact that they aren’t well-known or obvious correlations. We are interested in how diagnosis relates to the visualization of patient’s healthcare data and whether the data could be further analyzed to improve patients’ wellness. Through this project we aim to visualize our results, both surprising and obvious ones, in a way that best helps comprehension. 2.2 Data availability We are using datasets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted by the CDC. This survey was done every year prior to covid so we choose to use the most recent one available, 2017-2018 which can be found here. The survey design is extremely precise and well-documented and can be found here. The sampling is done in multi-year, stratified, clustered four-stage samples. The stages are: PSUs (counties, land within counties, or multiple counties combined), Segments within PSUs, Dwelling units within segments, and Individuals within dwelling units. Mobile surveying centers are sent out where participants answer questionnaires, have objective measures of their health taken like height and weight, and have samples taken such as blood and urine. Different features are separated into different datasets, each unified by a respondent sequence number primary key. The data is stored in SAS files. Starter code is given here for how to merge the datasets. The chosen datasets are joined over the respondents’ sequence number. We are interested in many of the different datasets which are categorized by the study. The first group is demographics data which can be found here. Within it we are interested in variables such as gender, age, race, military status, education level, number of people in the household, household income, etc. Next we are interested in the dietary data subgroup which can be found here. Within this dietary data we are interested in the total first day nutrient intakes. Within this dataset we are interested in things like calories consumed, macronutrient intake, vitamin intake, water intake, amount of seafood eaten, etc. The third category we look at is examination data found here. The datasets we are potentially interested in are blood pressure, and body measures. Body measures contain features such as BMI, height, weight, etc. Finally, we look at questionnaire data found here. There is a huge amount of data found in this category but these are a few that we are interested in. We may either cut some out or add more depending on how our future process goes. The datasets we are interested in begin with alcohol use with features like if you’ve ever drank, average number of drinks consumed in a week, or if you have ever had more than 4 for several days in a row (alcoholism), etc. Next there is diabetes with features like age diagnosed, suspected causes, symptoms, etc. After this is physical activity, things like minutes of vigorous, moderate, and sedentary activity throughout the day. Finally, there is a questionnaire about cigarette smoking, asking the age started, stopped, regularity, amount etc. The variable description and its type, source and link can be found here. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources The NHANES dataset is collected by employees in mobile surveying centers with the equipment needed to take measurements and collect samples as well as doing questionnaires. The approach is extremely well documented and can be found here. There was significantly more data than we possibly could have used in our project so we had to take extremely small subsets of it. Out of the many surveys we chose the demographics, body measures, nutrients, alcohol, disabilities, conditions, work, physical activity, and smoking datasets. Not every person filled out every survey. The demographics dataset is the baseline with 9254 respondents, and the rest of the surveys have less with the alcohol dataset having the least respondents with 5533. One challenge we faced was in the design of the survey: not answering a question is not the same as saying no. For example: not answering the smoking survey does not necessarily mean a participant doesn’t smoke. We had to factor this in to our analysis throughout the project. 3.1.1 Dataset columns We chose these columns based off our interest in questioning whether they were related to others. We took a much larger subset of the columns, then brainstormed possible associations in order to trim down the list. The columns we use in the demographics dataset are: ID, country of birth, level of education, household size, age (topcoded at 80), gender, household income, military status, and marital status. The columns used in the body measures dataset are: ID, weight (kg), and height (cm). The columns used in the nutrients dataset are: ID, calories (kcal), protein (g), carbs (g), sugar (g), fiber (g), total fat (g), cholesterol (mg), vitamin C (mg), sodium (mg), caffeine (mg), and water (g). The columns from the alcohol dataset are: ID and number of drinks per day. The disabilities columns are: ID and how often do you feel depressed. The columns we use from the conditions set are: ID and have you ever had cancer. The columns used in the work dataset are: ID and hours worked a week. From the physical activity dataset we use: ID, minutes recreational vigorous activity per day, miutes moderate per day, and minutes sedentary per day. Finally, the columns we use from the smoking dataset are: ID, number of cigarettes per day last month and age started smoking regularly. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation We download our data with a script based on the starter one NHANES provides here. We download each dataset separately then deal with merging them. Every entry in each dataset has a corresponding SEQN respondent ID which we left join over to create our total dataset. This ensures that each person gets a row in our database even if they didn’t answer every question. We do our preprocessing on a graph by graph basis because we use different portions of the dataset for each graph. The code is found dispersed throughout our graphs. Many of our columns are categorical with set responses which we find in codes in each dataset’s corresponding documentation on the NHANES website here. We also process these individually for the sake of ease. There are also some codes like 77,777 and 99,999 which refer to “refuse to answer” or “didn’t answer” which we also have to preprocess. 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 NA’s per Column In order to do missing value analysis we have to take a less coventional approach because we have so many columns merged together from different datasets. First, we show the number of NAs in each column. We see that things like number of cigarettes a day have higher counts of NA because they are more niche parts of the survey and are less likely to be filled out, whereas things like nutrition, body measurements, or demographics are either very low in NAs or not missing any. However, we cannot conclude from an NA that someone doesn’t smoke, we just have to remove it because they may still have been a smoker and not filled out the question. Next we take a look at a few of our datasets to see trends within them. 3.3.2 Pattern Analysis for Demographics Next we take a look at the demographics dataset specifically. Here we see that level of education, and marital status are tied for most missing and we can see 4/5 of our missing patterns are missing both these fields with none having one or the other. Perhaps this is due to the survey methods putting these two questions close together. We also see military status having a decent amount missing. Income also has a very tiny amount of values missing. The most common missing pattern is education, marital, and military which leads us to believe this was in fact, due to how the survey was given grouping these questions. 3.3.3 Pattern Analysis for Nutrition Next we look at the nutrition dataset. We see that the vast majority of the data is complete and there are only 2 missing patterns, one where none of the fields are filled, and one where just water is filled. This could be due to the fact that people answering did not want to count up all their nutrients, and water is a simple thing to list as it’s easy to estimate whereas the rest aren’t necessarily.

We see here several trends we observe in life and reveal some less obvoius ones. First, the range of adult female weights is centered lower than the male one. One less obvious observation about this is that the distribution of adult female weights is denser than the male ones. This could be due to the fact that men tend to be able to grow taller than women so the spread will be greater. Another trend we see is that the heights and weights of minors stays relatively the same until a certain point. If we did another threshold where puberty starts we would probably see an even more distinct cutoff point. The under 18 groups are able to reach about the same range of heights as their adult counterparts, however they don’t even come close to the outliers in weight in the adults. 4.2 Examination of Height vs. Weight by Age Started Smoking Here we want to see if the age someone starts smoking affects their height and weight later in life. We hypothesize the earlier one starts smoking the more stunted their growth. 4.2.1 Scatter of Height vs. Weight by Smoking Age Here we don’t see a pattern between smoking and height and weight. The colors of the points seem roughly uniformly distributed. We take a closer look at height with a some boxplots: 4.2.2 Boxplots of Height and Weight by Smoking Age And here we can also see the height distributions don’t seem to change based on when the participant started smoking. We also see the same is true for weight so it appears the age a smoker starts smoking doesn’t seem to be correlated with their height and weight, which is surprising to us because our initial hypothesis was that their height and weight would be stunted. 4.3 Heatmap of Smoking vs. Alcohol faceted by Cancer In this visualization we want to see if people with cancer smoke or drink more, possibly leading to their cancer. Here we see surprisingly that between drinking and smoking there does not seem to be a correlation in the non cancer group as we would imagine there is a positive correlation. However it appears the cancer group drinks significantly less than the non cancer group, possibly due to medication. Finally we see that smoking appears to not be correlated with cancer besides one outlying group at 60 cigarettes smoked per day, which could be because we take all cancer types not just lung cancer. 4.4 Scatterplot of Age vs. BMI by Marital Status Here we want to see the relationship between age and BMI and how it is affected by marital status. One hypothesis we have going in is the idea that people “let themselves go” the older they get and once they are married. First we see there is little correlation between BMI and age regardless of marital status. The data is relatively uniformly distributed throughout the graph. Next we observe there appears to be no difference between the married and not married groups. We define married as: currently married or living with partner and we consider not married as: widowed, divorced, separated, and never married. Looking at this graph it seems there is not enough evidence to say that people “let themselves go” after they get married. 4.5 Biplot of Total Nutrient Intake Now we want to see the correlations and clustering between different nutrient intakes. 4.5.1 Biplot with just rotation vectors: We see our first two PCs only account for 61.2% of the variance in the data, however we still see trends in our rotation vectors that seem to align with our real-world observations. Calories are somewhat positively correlated with all the main macro nutrients because the more someone eats, the more nutrients they get. However, it is the least correlated with water intake and vitamin c which don’t necessarily provide calorie intake. Then we see two clear correlated groups of features: cholesterol, protein, sodium, and fat which can be accounted to eating more meat, and fiber, carbohydrates, and sugar which can be attributed to grains. These two groups seem to not be correlated with each other which makes sense because they are not linked by many common foods. Finally, caffeine has a very small vector because it seems to not be correlated with the rest of the data. 4.5.2 Biplot with points: We subsample 120 points for readability in the graph while still maintaining our rotation vectors. It looks like the distribution has one main cluster in the left half of the graph below the average total nutrient intake where most people are, and then there is a more sparse spread beyond that, maybe because people who eat more tend to have more specialized or unhealthy diets. Additionally, perhaps there are more outliers on the right side because you can always eat more but it’s physically impossible to eat below a certain threshold. 4.6 Parallel Coordinates Plot of Nutrients by Income Group Here we want to see if diet changes by income group. Here we can see that while there are no obvious trends in this tiny subset of our data, we can see that there are some minor groupings by color in areas like protein/sodium/cholesterol where the 20,000-74,999 group is clustered together higher than the 100,000 and over group. We find it interesting that we see smaller more localized trends, however we don’t see one large, overarching trend in income vs. nutrients. 4.7 Heatmap of Work Hours vs. Caffeine Consumption In examining the relationship between work hours and caffeine consumption after removing drastic outliers, we shockingly see that there is no correlation between the two. The majority of people drink 1-2 cups (100-200mg) of coffee a day with some minor outliers evenly distributed throughout different values of weekly work hours. We find the lack of correlation here more surprising than seeing one because we expected to see a positive relationship between the two. 4.8 Distribution of Work Hours for different Education Levels In the above histograms, we notice that the number of hours worked in a week does not vary considerably by the education level. As expected, we see that most individuals work for 40 hours per week, irrespective of education level. We also notice that individuals that are college graduates or above, have a larger proportion of people working 50 hours per week compared to that in any other group. Additionally, college graduates have a lower proportion of individuals working less than 40 hours in comparison to that in any other group. This gives us an idea that individuals who at least have a college degree are more likely to work longer hours. 4.9 Mosaic Plot of Depression vs Military Status In the above mosaic plot, we notice that the proportion of people who feel depressed at most monthly is higher among those individuals who served in the army. Although the difference is very slight, we can clearly tell this difference by comparing the stack of cells for “Daily”, “Weekly” and “Monthly” groups. We expected this finding because it is widely known that serving in the army exposes individuals to circumstances that harm mental health. 4.10 Mosaic Plot of Education Level vs Depression vs Income We are able to make some interesting observations from the above mosaic plot. Firstly, we notice that individuals with higher education tend to make more money. Secondly, we notice that individuals who make lesser money feel more depressed. We also see that the “College / AA Degree 0-20k” group has the highest proportion of depression. This gives us an indication that individuals who pursue their education longer but make less money, tend to be more depressed. This could be because of student debt, or simply because they compare themselves with others with similar higher education who make more than them. While our reasoning is nothing more than speculation, we can certainly tell that individuals who make more money are less likely to feel depressed "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component Studies show that recalling information after you learn it can help solidify it in your long-term memory.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Main Takeaways 6.2 Limitations, Future Directions, Lessons Learned", " Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Main Takeaways In our analysis we weren’t able to find evidence for some of our questions, however for others we found some interesting trends. When we examined height vs. weight by age started smoking, we expected to find that those who had started smoking earlier would have a much lower distribution in both fields, especially in height. However, we saw that all our age groups had roughly identical uniform distributions which meant we didn’t see a trend corroborating our idea that smoking earlier makes you shorter. Looking at cigarette smoking vs. alcohol consumption faceted by cancer, we didn’t find that people with cancer smoked and drank more. Our idea was that smoking causes cancer or that people with cancer would potentially give into their vices. However, we found that there wasn’t really an association between cancer and smoking and drinking. This could be due to the fact that cancer patients are probably on medication or hospitalized and not able to smoke or drink. In the scatterplot of BMI vs. age by marital status, we expected to see BMI getting higher with age and marital status also increasing BMI. However, we saw that the distribution stayed uniform throughout, showing that the range of BMIs stays the same regardless of age and marital status. Our histograms of work hours faceted on level of education didn’t show us much. We thought that we would see a greater difference in work hours for those with higher education, however there is only a marginal upwards shift. In our heatmap of height vs. weight faceted by age and gender, we saw evidence of some trends that we find interesting because we weren’t looking for them. Adult women tend to have a denser distribution of weights compared to men, and the distributions of child height and weight tend to stay the same regardless of gender until a certain point where they diverge, probably puberty. Our heatmap of hours worked vs. coffee consumption actually surprised us because we couldn’t find evidence of our common sense claim. Our idea was that obviously those who work more hours would tend to drink more coffee, but we found the distribution of coffee drinking to be uniform. Looking at our parallel coordinates plot of nutrients by income group, we were able to see some minor trends between the various income groups, but nothing substantial enough to make a broader claim. In our biplot of nutrients, we were actually able to find evidence of our common sense claim. Calories generally were positively correlated with all nutrients because all nutrients provide calories, except for water and vitamin c which don’t. And 2 main groups of nutrients appeared: those that tended to come from meats vs. grains and vegetables. We actually find interesting results in our mosaic of military service and depression. We see that those who served in the military are very slightly more likely to be depressed. We also consider the idea that depression is relatively subjective when surveyed which could affect our results. Finally, in our mosaic of income, education level, and depression, we see very interestingly that those with higher education in the lower income group had the highest level of depression which is an interesting finding we did not consider beforehand. 6.2 Limitations, Future Directions, Lessons Learned We wish we could have used more of the data and examined more relationships because NHANES is a treasure trove of data, but with the limited time of the project we were unable to explore all the relationships we could have. In the future we would want to take our exploration one step further than we went. For example: we found that people who have lower income tend to have more depression if they are educated, but now we want to examine things like financial info and debt to take our analysis one step further and see if this depression is caused by something monetary or mental. Throughout the project one major lesson learned was to not assume a negative with mising data, for example: a lack of alcohol data doesn’t mean an individual doesn’t drink. We had to restructure our thinking around this idea a few times throughout the process.
